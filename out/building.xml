   Need a place to work on your bike? The Campus Bike Centre, located in the Studley Gym, offers drop-in sessions and classes in bicycle repair/maintenance and cycling safety education. Staff/volunteers work with bike owners to help locate and fix problems. You can't drop off a bike to be fixed. The Bike Centre is not a bike shop -- rather, it is a bike workshop.

   The Fur Unit was initiated in 1984 as a teaching and research unit. The animal housing facilities include a pelter shed and individual outside breeder pens for silver foxes and two traditional two-row sheds for mink. The unit also houses American Marten. An additional building, opened in 1989, includes a feed kitchen, metabolism rooms, a laboratory, and an office. A new, technologically advanced mink facility is being constructed to enhance research and development capability in the Canadian Centre for Fur Animal Research (CCFAR).

   The first building constructed on Dalhousie's Studley campus, this gracious, Georgian-styled building is currently occupied by the Department of Chemistry. During 1964-65, a link was constructed to the Macdonald Library, creating 40,000 square feet of new floor space. Renovations in 1991 added almost 23,000 square feet on the north side of the building, including new undergraduate laboratories.

   The Chute Animal Nutrition Centre is a state of the art feed preparation facility with capabilities for all animal species. The nutrition complex is capable of large and small batch mixing, ranging from five kilos to 200 kilos and commercial-style pelleting of feeds. For this reason, this is an important support feature for research trials requiring short runs of specialized feed.  It is equipped with increased biosecurity with one directional flow, classroom space, and exterior bins for feed delivery. The Centre is named in honour of the late Dr. Harold Chute, a Class of ’44 alumnus, who was the most energetic proponent of the need for the facility and who is the largest single benefactor for the project. Dr. Chute was awarded an Honourary Degree in 1998, the Distinguished Alumnus Award in 1994 and the Honourary Associate Award in 1976.
